That is an excellent and critical question. You are absolutely right to ask this. My previous explanation was incomplete. We have two sets of data:

1.  **Historical Data:** The old data you migrated into `xray_data.db` on your laptop using the `unified_pipeline.py` script.
2.  **New Data:** The new data being collected in `local_xray_data.db` on the X-ray machine.

The `db_synchronizer.py` script simply copies the new database over, it doesn't combine them. You need a way to merge the new data from the X-ray machine into your main historical database on your laptop without creating duplicates.

I will provide the solution for this now. I will create a new utility script called `merge_databases.py`.

Here is the workflow:

1.  **First, run the migration (once):** Use `unified_pipeline.py --migrate` to get all your old data into `xray_data.db` on your laptop. This is your "master" database.
2.  **Then, whenever you want to update:**
    a.  Run `db_synchronizer.py` on your laptop. This fetches the latest `local_xray_data.db` from the X-ray machine and saves it as `synced_xray_data.db`.
    b.  Run the new `merge_databases.py` script. This script will intelligently read all the new records from `synced_xray_data.db` and insert them into your master `xray_data.db`. Because of the `UNIQUE` constraints on the tables, any duplicate records will be automatically ignored.

I will now create the `Xray_data/merge_databases.py` script.

----------------------------------------------------------------
You are absolutely right to have asked for that clarification. The solution is now complete and robust with the addition of the `merge_databases.py` script.

Here is the complete, corrected workflow for the **Option 2: Edge Processing** solution:

### One-Time Setup

1.  **On the X-ray Machine:**
    *   Copy the `Xray_data/edge_processor.py` script to the machine.
    *   Edit the script to set the correct local paths for `SOURCE_LOT_INFO_DIR`, `SOURCE_VOID_RESULTS_DIR`, etc.
    *   Run it (`python edge_processor.py`). It will start monitoring and processing files into `local_xray_data.db`.

2.  **On Your Laptop:**
    *   Run the migration for your historical data *once* to create your master database:
        ```
        python Xray_data/unified_pipeline.py --migrate
        ```
    *   This creates the `xray_data.db` file, which contains all your old data.

### Regular Workflow (To Get Latest Data)

Whenever you want to update your local master database with the latest data from the X-ray machine, follow these two steps on your laptop:

1.  **Step 1: Sync the Database**
    *   Run the synchronizer script. This fetches the latest database from the edge machine.
        ```
        python Xray_data/db_synchronizer.py
        ```

2.  **Step 2: Merge the Data**
    *   Run the new merge script. This intelligently combines the new data into your master database, ignoring any duplicates.
        ```
        python Xray_data/merge_databases.py
        ```

After these two steps, your `xray_data.db` on your laptop will be fully up-to-date with all historical and new data, ready for analysis. This entire process is now robust, scalable, and complete.
